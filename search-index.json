We are the ones who will fetch the dreams of every Descartistani and bring them to life. King Daris, with his sharp intellect and boundless energy, is the watchdog our nation needs. His vision for Descartistan is one of growth, where every citizen can wag their tail with pride. Regent Samy, known for his keen sense of justice, will stand by King Daris like a faithful companion, ensuring that no one is left out in the cold.\nTogether, they will lead Descartistan into a new era, where peace is not just a distant dream but a reality we can sink our teeth into. The DOG party is here to sniff out corruption, dig up the roots of evil, and bury them once and for all. With us, you can be sure that the future of Descartistan is in safe paws.\nSo, as you cast your vote, remember: a vote for the DOG party is a vote for loyalty, security, and a brighter future. Don’t let the opposition pull the wool over your eyes—choose the party that will guard our nation like a loyal dog guards its home. King Daris and Regent Samy are ready to lead Descartistan with the courage of a lion and the heart of a loyal hound. It\u0026rsquo;s time to let the DOG party take the lead—because with us, every dog will have its day.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":0,"permalink":"/blog/dog-think-tank/","summary":"About the DOG.","tags":[],"title":"Dog Think tank"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":1,"permalink":"/blog/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Blog"},{"content":"https://github.com/thuliteio/doks.git In order to protect the people of Descartistan and its values, a bill of rot has been declared.\n1st AMENDMENT : Grand Jury, Double Jeopardy, Self Incrimination, Due Process, Takings.
