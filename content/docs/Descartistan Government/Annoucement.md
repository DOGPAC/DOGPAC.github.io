We are thrilled to announce the formation of the **Democratic Order for Growth** (DOG), a new political party dedicated to honoring the rich history of Descartistan and shaping a prosperous future. Our mission is to refine the Grand Principality of Descartistan by promoting stability and, most importantly, growth.

**King Daris Idirene**, the first of his name, will run for the presidency with a bold vision to eliminate corruption and safeguard our principality against those who falsely claim loyalty. In this pursuit, **Daris** and his running mate, **Vice-President Samy Mehdi**, aim to bring transformative change to Descartistan.

Should we emerge victorious, it will be King Daris’s honor to appoint Samy Mehdi as the **Presumptive Regent of Descartistan’s Loyalty**, a position of utmost importance in securing the integrity and prosperity of our nation.

In the lead-up to the forthcoming election, the Democratic Order for Growth is actively recruiting and offering positions to dedicated citizens of Descartistan who share our values and vision. Join us in building a brighter futu²re for our beloved principality.

**Join the Movement. Support Growth.**
**Long live Descartistan and the King**


Welcome to the Descartistan official,
