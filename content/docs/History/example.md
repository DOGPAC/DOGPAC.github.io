# Daris' spark of brilliance
It all started when Daris, proclaimed the great congress of ping pong; where members such as Aigle the dominant, Djawad the Macho, Anis the Bold debated on a philosophical matter, Anis the Bold singlehandedlyheld of the coalition against him, Anis defended F1 with might and didn't back down, on the other side Aigle mischevoius as he is, plotted to frame Anis.
The debate had ran on for hours, and with each minute Anis grew with fury. Aigle thought to use it to his ability, that's when he brought up volley, Anis angry, had left Descartistan temporarily.
